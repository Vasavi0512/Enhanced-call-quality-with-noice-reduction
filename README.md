We have ran a sample code. The noise cancellation was not completely filtered according to different environmental conditions but we were able to observe a significant difference between original and filtered audio.

after the first review the code has some fixed threshold value. After 2nd review we made ran a code by taking adaptive threshold values acording to the audio and also a comparitive study by taking differnt approaches for adaptive thereshold.
